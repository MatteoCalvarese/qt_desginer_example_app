# qt_designer_example_app
This a simple Qt-based app that can be used as an introductory example to create more complex Qt-based applications.
The Qt UI is created by Qt-Designer and imported in the file, for easier prototyping of the GUI components.
The app is simply starting a connection with the host PC webcam (nr. 0) and plots the acquired image with a given refresh rate.
